### Description

After searching forever for a good way to allow users to resize or move controls around on the form at runtime, I decided that I should just make my own method. The other ones I found here use the API method, which does not work well.

I have updated this to include the suggestions based on the feedback. While the "trails" are still there, they are much better, and the code is alot cleaner &amp; smaller now.
 
### More Info
 
read the comments in the module for how to use this , it's extremely simple.
